Hi there! I’m an IT Infrastructure and Cybersecurity Engineer with 8+ years of hands-on experience in managing, securing, and optimizing IT systems in various environments. I specialize in Microsoft Server OS, Active Directory, Azure, Office 365, and cloud platforms. I'm passionate about implementing security best practices, detecting threats, and responding to incidents while making systems run more efficiently. I love using my technical skills to help improve security and reduce risks, and I’m always looking for new challenges to drive IT security and cloud infrastructure forward. Let's connect!


## Objective


I aim to leverage my expertise in cloud platforms, security frameworks, and incident response to transition into a role as a SOC Analyst, Penetration Tester, or Cloud Security Engineer. My passion for safeguarding IT systems, combined with hands-on experience in managing Microsoft environments, Azure, and implementing security best practices, will allow me to contribute effectively to enhancing security postures and mitigating emerging threats.
